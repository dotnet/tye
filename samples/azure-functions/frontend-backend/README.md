# Frontend-backend example
A simple example showing a frontend and backend function app.

## For running

Simply execute `tye run` and navigate to the frontend. You should see a response with information from the frontend and backend.

> :bulb: Note, you may need to create a local.settings.json file to specify the language default. Tye currently doesn't specify the language by default.

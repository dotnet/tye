  # If you want to use a different tag or container port
  # placement-image: daprio/dapr
  # placement-container-port: 50005

  # log-level configures the log level of the dapr sidecar
  log-level: debug

  # config allows you to pass additional configuration into the dapr sidecar
  # config will be interpreted as a named k8s resource when deployed, and will be interpreted as
  # a file on disk when running locally at `./components/myconfig.yaml`
  #
  # config: myconfig

  # components-path configures the components path of the dapr sidecard
  # components-path: "./components/"

  # You can instruct Tye to not create the Dapr placement container on your behalf. This is required if you have Dapr running and want to use that container.
  # Doing a `docker ps` can show if its already running. If it's running then you can set 'exclude-placement-container: true' with `placement-port: xxxx` set to the host port of that container.
  # (i.e. In Windows + WSL2, Dapr uses 6050 as the host port)

  # exclude-placement-container: true
  # placement-port: 6050

  # log-level configures the log level of the dapr sidecar
  log-level: debug

  # config allows you to pass additional configuration into the dapr sidecar
  # config will be interpreted as a named k8s resource when deployed, and will be interpreted as
  # a file on disk when running locally at `./components/myconfig.yaml`

  # if you don't want Tye to create the placement container on your behalf. This is required if you have Dapr running and want to use that container.
  # Doing a `docker ps` can show if its already running. If that's not the case then comment out out when running locally.

  # if you want to define the Dapr placement container port.
  # You can use this in combinations with 'exclude-placement-container' to use an existing container instance managed by Dapr (i.e. In Windows, Dapr uses 6050 as the host port)
  # or if the default port 50005 port is being used by something else

# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. At this point in the tye project we welcome anyone's feedback on where tye help you to succeed or caused you trouble. 

You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes to address an open issue, or improve documentation.

## General feedback and discussions?

Create a [feedback issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=feedback.md).

We know that there's a lot of diversity in how people work, think, and organize projects. We'd love to know if tye is a good fit for the way that you do your best work.

If we don't have follow up discussions or questions, we'll probably close your issue with a simple "Thanks!", and link it to some other issues that we're tracking. Getting feedback in the form of issues is helpful to the team, regardless of whether its negative or positive.

Or if there's a top if you want to discuss, create a [discussion issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=discussion.md).

Feel free to create discussion issues if there's something you want ask about. We may close your issue if there's an easy answer, or we may leave it open so that others are encouraged to comment and share their point of view.

## Bugs and feature requests?

For non-security related bugs, log a new [bug issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=bug.md). 

Keep in mind that tye is an experimental project. We do care about the quality of the features that we're building, but we don't plan to address every bug quickly because the lifespan of the project is short.

---

For feature requests, log a new [idea issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=idea.md).

Tye is an experimental project with a short roadmap. We plan to at least be honest about what ideas we think we can accomplish within the scope of the project. We might say no, or "not now" to lots of ideas as a result.

## Reporting security issues and bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

## Contributing code and content

We accept fixes and features! Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.

* Look at the [Developer documentation](/docs/developer_guide.md) to get started on building the source code on your own.
* ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.
* ["Good first issue" issues](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/labels/good%20first%20issue) - we think these are a good for newcomers.

### Before you send a pull request

We prefer to have a discussion via an issues before reviewing a PR especially if the changes are extensive or if the PR adds a feature that we haven't agreed to add. 

If you are sending a PR for an existing issue, please comment on the issue so that others can see that someone is working on it. It may not be a bad idea to comment before you start work, because the team might have suggestions.

We don't expect an issue for minor improvements like:

- Correcting grammar or spelling
- Correcting documentation mistakes

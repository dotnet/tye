# Project Tye

Tye is a tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed applications easier. Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration. 

What tye can do:

- Run multiple projects locally.
- Easily manage dependencies running containers.
- Automatically build Docker images by following .NET's conventions.
- Deploy applications to Kubernetes with minimal configuration.
- Make secret management and service discovery easy.

## Current Status

Project Tye is an open source experiment that will last at least until Nov 2020. We are using this time to try radical ideas to improve microservices developer productivity and see what works. 

We plan to do releases with new features roughly every 4 weeks.

For the duration of the experiment, consider every part of the tye experience to be volatile. We will frequently make additions and changes to features that seem polished. We welcome feedback from anyone who's willing to be an early-adopter with tye; the team wants to know what's working well, and what's missing to build a whole-package .NET microservices developer productivity suite.

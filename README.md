# Tye

What tye can do:

- Run multiple projects locally.
- Easily manage dependencies running containers.
- Automatically build Docker images by following .NET's conventions.
- Generate manifests for Kubenetes (static deployments/services, Helm Charts, OAM).
- Express relationships and dependencies between services.
- Make secret management and service discovery easy.
- Let you configure all of this with C# code (`.csx`) or yaml!

## Current Status

![CI](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Tye is the combination of [Opulence](https://github.com/rynowak/opulence) and [Micronetes](https://github.com/davidfowl/micronetes) into a single tool.

There's not much to see here right now, but keep watching this space for updates.
